          I'm inside a div!when <em>spending</em> more than 25 minutes in the
          kitchen just won’t do and, unlike lots of recipes that claim to
          simplify <strong>dinnertime</strong> , ours are truly all-in-one
          meals. You could toss some bread on the table, if you’d like, but
          ultimately, we’ve got multiple food groups on each plate and every
          bowl because, really, who’s got time for several courses? Pin this
          slideshow of simple dinner ideas for later when you’re finding your
          go-to menus are getting a little tired.
