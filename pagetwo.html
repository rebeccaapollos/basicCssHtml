        when spending more than 25 minutes in the kitchen just won’t do and,
        unlike lots of recipes that claim to simplify dinnertime, ours are truly
        all-in-one meals. You could toss some bread on the table, if you’d like,
        but ultimately, we’ve got multiple food groups on each plate and every
        bowl because, really, who’s got time for several courses? Pin this
        slideshow of simple dinner ideas for later when you’re finding your
        go-to menus are getting a little tired.
